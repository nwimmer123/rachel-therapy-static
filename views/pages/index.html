      <p>Everyone has times in life when they feel frustration, anxiety, or depletion. We live in a complex and demanding world, where it's difficult to maintain balance, focus, and perspective. A skilled therapist can help you understand yourself, create change in your circumstances, or develop effective coping skills when current circumstances cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>With thoughtful and compassionate psychotherapy, I can help you bring about personal growth and change. I offer therapy for individuals, couples, children, teens and families. I value work with all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and spiritual beliefs.</p>
      <p>In my years of experience I have helped people combat depression and anxiety, take risks, gain self-confidence, become more successful, access their creativity, feel more fulfilled in their careers, and obtain the self-knowledge that leads to healthier, stronger, and more satisfying relationships.</p>
      <p>I can help if you find yourself:</p>
      <ul class="textlist">
        <li>Focusing more on what you are doing wrong, than focusing on what you are doing well.</li>
        <li>Unable to care for yourself because you are attending to the needs of others.</li>
        <li>Criticizing yourself more than seems reasonable.</li>
        <li>Hurting yourself physically.</li>
        <li>Staying in relationships that make you feel bad about yourself.</li>
        <li>Wanting to be in relationships that are different than the relationships you learned in your family, but not knowing how. </li>
        <li>Feeling lethargic or uninterested in things that used to bring you pleasure.</li>
        <li>Soothing yourself often with food, drugs or alcohol, work, television or otherwise distracting yourself from your present circumstances.</li>
        <li>Comparing yourself to others in a way that makes you feel bad about yourself.</li>
        <li>Questioning the meaning of life, or your purpose in life.</li>
        <li>Questioning the major choices you have made.</li>
        <li>Unable to connect with the people closest to you.</li>
        <li>Without the connections to family, friends or romantic partners that you would like.</li>
        <li>Unable to move on from past losses or traumas.</li>
        <li>Unable to forgive yourself.</li>
        <li>Wishing your life was considerably different than how it is.</li>
        <li>Thinking and hoping that the future will be very different than the present.</li>
        <li>Ruminating on things that happened to you in the past.</li>
      </ul>
