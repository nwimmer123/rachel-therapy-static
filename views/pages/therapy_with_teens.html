      <h3>Therapy with Teens</h3>
      <p>The teenage years are often a challenging time for both adolescents and their families. Teenagers wrestle with adult desires, crave independence, and believe they are entitled to it, while forgetting that they are not yet adults and are still under their parents’ roof. Even the most patient parent(s) might feel at their wits end at times when talking with their teenage children. Parents often experience that the best way to find out what is really going on with their teens is to have someone else ask them.</p>
      <p>Today’s teenagers are under a great deal of stress and are often silenced by their many social, academic and family pressures. Providing teens with the opportunity to take part in their own therapy allows them to further develop skills which promote maturity, safe independence and safe decision-making. Therapy for adolescents and teens can help teens improve their overall functioning at home, school, within the family, and with peers and their social environment. </p>
